ghb requires recent a recent version of glib with gio.  These
are available in ubuntu 8.04 and fedora 9.  I don't know about other
distributions.

Currently, to build you must build handbrake separately, then
autogen and build the gtk ui. e.g.

./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install

You can test without installing:
cd src
./ghb

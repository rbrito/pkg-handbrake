Subject: Remove forcing PGS subtitles to be included.

This needs a not-so short patch to libav/ffmpeg to be handled. I guess that
the libraries aren't up to what the multimedia applications need.

But then, I have *not* studied if the libraries offer any other, perhaps
superior, alternative to what handbrake is doing here.
